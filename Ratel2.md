## Caddx Ratel2 Night Version 1500TVL

An optimized configuration guide for the Caddx Ratel 2 (Night Version) to achieve the best image quality for both high-speed freestyle and low-light "Starlight" conditions.

## Overview
The Caddx Ratel 2 Night Version is a premium analog FPV camera featuring a 1/1.18" Starlight HDR sensor. Unlike the standard Ratel 2, the Night Version (often associated with the "Pro" or updated lens models) is specifically tuned for ultra-low light sensitivity (0.0001 Lux) while maintaining a high 1200TVL–1500TVL resolution.

### Key Specifications
* **Sensor:** 1/1.18" Starlight HDR
* **Resolution:** 1200TVL
* **Min. Illumination:** 0.0001 Lux
* **WDR:** Super WDR (HDR)
* **Field of View:** 165°
* **Input Power:** 4.5V - 36V

## Recommended Settings
To access these settings, connect the included 5D-OSD menu board to the camera's OSD pin.

### 1. Exposure (AE)
* **Brightness:** `12` (Lowering slightly from the default 13 helps prevent highlight clipping in bright sky).
* **Exposure Mode:** `Global` (Most consistent for freestyle and changing environments).
* **D-WDR:** `Open` (Crucial for seeing into shadows when flying toward the sun).

### 2. Video Settings
* **Video Standard:** `PAL` (Recommended for higher vertical resolution: 576i vs NTSC's 480i).
* **Image Ratio:** `4:3` or `16:9` (Match this strictly to your goggles' native aspect ratio).
* **3DNR:** `Medium` (Reduces noise in low light without causing excessive "ghosting" artifacts).

### 3. Image Enhance
* **Contrast:** `Manual -> 15-18` (Increase slightly if the image looks too "flat" in overcast conditions).
* **Sharpness:** `Manual -> 6` (The Ratel 2 is naturally sharp; avoid high values to prevent digital shimmering).
* **Color Gain:** `Manual -> 12` (Provides a vibrant look without over-saturating reds and greens).

### 4. Day & Night (Low Light Tuning)
* **Mode:** `Auto` (Reliable for transition periods like sunset).
* **Color:** When flying in outdoor normal lighting conditions, Set to color mode for maximum contrast and saturation of the image 
* **B&W (Extreme Dark):** If flying in near-total darkness, manually switch to `B&W`. This maximizes light sensitivity and removes color noise.
